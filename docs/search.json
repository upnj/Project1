    "text": "The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) Census API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of data files from the United States Census Bureau that provides access to data samples of the U.S. population and housing units. More specifically, these PUMS data sets cover the HUD’s (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) largest rental assistance programs (Public Housing, Section 8, etc). This data is compiled from responses to the American Community Surveys (ACS). The PUMS is comprised of two files: one for person records and the other for housing unit records. It includes geographic and household information including, but not limited to: family type, household income, race, gender, etc. The PUMS’ data sets are valuable sources of information to policymakers and the researchers, as it can give some insight on how to better allocate resources and focus on helping those who need it the most.\nBy leveraging these data sets, we hope to not only grow our R skills, but to learn a little more about the world around us. For the first half, we’ll be working on building functions, both helper and main functions, that will help us examine, check, process, manipulate, and build our main function to query PUMS’ API. The second half of the project will build onto the first and delve into functions to that will summarize data and create visuals.\nFirst thing’s first, with every R project, we install and load in the necessary packaaes to help create functions to do what we need.\n\n\n# Loading packages\n#install.packages(\"quantreg\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to show how URL can interact with the PUMS’ API. Typically we’d start with a more bare URL when building a URL from scratch (more on that later), but I ended choosing this one because it provided a more visually appealing output as an example. After setting up the URL and making a GET, request to PUMS’ API (a request sent to a server asking an API to provide a service/information), we’ll take that raw data, and parse it into JSON. The initial_parse returns a tibble with the column names on the first row, so we extract those names and set them as the column names. Then we drop the first row and print a nice little tibble to get a glimpse of what information the example_url contains (take a look below!). Here we have a small tibble, 6x4, because we used the function head. These are the steps to querying APIs. So in short, we assign a URL, formulate the API request, send it, allow time to handle the response, and process the data.\n\n\n# Sample API call, transformed to tibble\nexample_url &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&SCHL=24\"\ninitial_response &lt;- GET(url = example_url)\ninitial_parse &lt;- fromJSON(rawToChar(initial_response$content))\ncol_names &lt;- (initial_parse[1,])\ncolnames(initial_parse) &lt;- col_names\ninitial_parse &lt;- initial_parse[-1,]\ninitial_parse &lt;- as_tibble(initial_parse)\nhead(initial_parse)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  SEX   PWGTP MAR   SCHL \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2     6     5     24   \n2 2     23    2     24   \n3 1     23    3     24   \n4 1     80    5     24   \n5 1     16    1     24   \n6 1     107   3     24   \n\n\n\nTo keep things simple and organized, below are all of the variables and their assigned values. Here we created vectors for each variable to reference later on.\n\n\n# Numeric variables\nnum_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\")\n\n# Categorical variables\ncat_vars &lt;- c(\"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\")\n\n# Time variables\ntime_vars &lt;- c(\"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n\n# Geography variables\ngeo_vars &lt;- c(\"All\", \"Region\", \"Division\", \"State\")\n\n# Combined variables (numeric categorical, time)\ncombined_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\", \"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\", \"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n\n\nNext we’ll dive into all of the functions we made in order to create our main API query. The first one we have is the year_checker function. Our if statement here only allows the function to pass if the year is between 2010 to 2022 (values are inclusive). However, if the year falls outside of the range, a stop function will raise an error message and cease execution of the code.\n\n\n# Year Checker\n# Function to check if entered year is valid\n\nyear_checker &lt;- function(year) {\n  if (year &gt; 2022 | year &lt; 2010) {\n    stop(\"Invalid year value. Please type in a number between 2010 and 2022.\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nOur second function, the num_checker, checks and coerces our assigned numeric and time variables to their respective data types. Due to the parsed JSON data, our data defaulted to a data type of character. Coercing the variables to the desired data type allows for meaning manipulation and analysis. This function contains 1 parameter and takes in 2 vectors, num_vars and time_vars, which is used to determine if the user input is of type num or time then converts it respectively to its desired data type. The function works by looping the column names from initial_parse. Each column name is checked to see if its name matches any from the 2 vectors, num_vars or time_vars. If the column name matches in num_vars, it will be converted to numeric through the use of as.numeric. Similarly with time_vars, it will be converted to a time format through the use of as.POSIXct. Once the function finishes looping, it will return the modified tibble/dataframe.\n\n\n# Numeric Checker\n# Function to convert columns to desired numeric data types\n\nnum_checker &lt;- function(initial_parse) {\n    num_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\")\n    time_vars &lt;- c(\"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n    col_names &lt;- colnames(initial_parse) \n      for (name in col_names) {\n         if (name %in% num_vars) {\n            print(name)   \n            initial_parse[[name]] &lt;- as.numeric(initial_parse[[name]])\n            \n         }\n        if (name %in% time_vars) {\n            print(name)   \n            #initial_parse[[name]] &lt;- as.POSIXct(initial_parse[[name]], format = \"%H:%M\")\n            \n        }\n      }\n    return(initial_parse)\n}\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# initial_parse &lt;- num_checker(initial_parse)\n\n\nOur time checker function works to change our time_vars into desired time data tpes.\n\n\n# Time Checker - NOT FINISHED\n# Function to convert columns to desired time data types\n# Currently NOT a function yet, but almost\n\n# JWAP - Example J.

This function contains 1 parameter and takes in 1 vector, which is used to determine if the user input is of type factor then converts it respectively to its desired data type.\n\n\n# Categorical checker\n# Function to convert columns to desired factor data types\n\ncat_checker &lt;- function(initial_parse) {\n    cat_vars &lt;- c(\"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\")\n    col_names &lt;- colnames(initial_parse) \n      for (name in col_names) {\n         if (name %in% cat_vars) {\n            print(name)   \n            initial_parse[[name]] &lt;- as.factor(initial_parse[[name]])\n    }\n      }\n    initial_parse &lt;- initial_parse %&gt;%\n      mutate(\n        SEX = recode(SEX, \"1\" = \"Male\", \"2\" = \"Female\"))\n      return(initial_parse)\n}\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# cat_checker(initial_parse)\n\n\nNext we have the geography checker. This function has 1 parameter and takes in 1 vector. If the provided geography_level is in the geo_vars vector, it will print that the geography level is valid. If not then it will print is not valid.\n\n\n# Geography Checker\n# Function to specify and  check if geography level is correct\n\ngeo_checker &lt;- function(geography_level, geography_subset) {\n  geo_vars &lt;- c(\"All\", \"Region\", \"Division\", \"State\")\n  if (geography_level %in% geo_vars) {\n    print(\"Geography level is valid.\") \n  }\n  else {\n    print(\"Geography level is not valid.\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# geo_checker(\"State\", \"08\")\n\n\nHere we have a function to query the census. This function contains 4 parameters. First, an empty tibble is initialized in order to store the results; this is important as it holds the multiple tibbles to later bind together. We assign a variable named year_list to take on the function string split for parameter, year, because we want to allow the user to be able to specify multiple years of survey data. String split works here because when inputting multiple years, “2012,2013,2015”, the user needs to input the years all as one string, then strsplit will work to split the different years into a list of year to call each year separately. The for loop at the bottom, (i in year_list[[1]]), loops over the list of years from the user into the query_url, allowing them to make API requests for each given year.\nNext, there are some words that we hard coded into the URL because we needed to return those columns, we chose: “PWGTP”, “GASP”, and “FER”. However, if the user doesn’t know, they could input one of these columns again, producing a duplicate column. To fix this, we have to use grepl, to search for a string within a string then we use gsub to remove the said string. The second gsub is a catch all, removing commas from before/after the string due to user input. This way, even if the user inputs those columns, it would no longer create a duplicate. Then we create an if statement where it does not allow the user to input a geography_subset if they choose “All” by creating a variable named geo_meta and add it onto our query_url below. So to briefly go over our first example, bottom portion of the code is using the given query_url, we send a GET request to formulate the API request, allow time to handle the response, process the data, extract column nam, apply them accordingly, then create tibbles. As mentioned earlier, if user inputs multiple years then the for loop won’t end until the last inputted year, then the bind_rows function will combine all of the tibbles from each year of the user input together.\n\n\n# Function to Query the Census API \n# Created if statements using grepl/gsub to remove duplicate columns\n# Allow users to call multiple years then combining tibbles as the end using bind_rowss\n# Used helper GET here then turned into tibble\n\ncensus_query &lt;- function(year, geography_level, geography_subset, get) {\n    initial_parse_final &lt;- tibble()\n    year_list &lt;- strsplit(year, \",\")\n    url &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/\"\n    if (grepl(\"PWGTP\", get)) {\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"PWGTP|PWGTP,\",'',get) # to remove actual value or the comma after\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"^\\\\,|\\\\,$\",'',get) # catch all, if there's a comma before/after of user input\n    }\n    if (grepl(\"GASP\", get)) {\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"GASP|GASP,\",'',get)\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"^\\\\,|\\\\,$\",'',get)\n    }\n    if (grepl(\"FER\", get)) {\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"FER|FER,\",'',get)\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"^\\\\,|\\\\,$\",'',get)\n    }\n    geo_meta &lt;- paste0(\"&for=\", geography_level,\":\",geography_subset)\n    if (geography_level == \"All\") {\n      geo_meta &lt;- \"\"\n    }\n    for (i in year_list[[1]]) {\n      query_url &lt;- paste0(url,i,\"/acs/acs1/pums?\",\"get=PWGTP,GASP,FER,\",get,geo_meta)\n      initial_response &lt;- GET(url = query_url)\n      initial_parse &lt;- fromJSON(rawToChar(initial_response$content))\n      col_names &lt;- (initial_parse[1,])\n      colnames(initial_parse) &lt;- col_names\n      initial_parse &lt;- initial_parse[-1,]\n      initial_parse &lt;- as_tibble(initial_parse)\n      initial_parse_final &lt;- bind_rows(initial_parse,initial_parse_final)\n    }\n    return(initial_parse_final)\n}\n\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# initial_parse &lt;- census_query(year = \"2011,2014\", \"State\", \"08\", \"AGEP,SEX\")\n\n\nNow we can create our final/main API query. This API query contains 4 parameters (year = “2022”, geography_level = “All”, geography_subset and get = “SEX,AGEP,PWGTP”, with their respective defaults) and takes in vector combined_vars. We create a strsplit for the get results, similarly to what we did for the years in the census_query results. When a user inputs variables, it will check and ensure those column names are valid. If they are then it will print, “Column X entered is valid” and if not then it will tell the user to try again. After that, initial_parse is reassigned and overwritten once it goes through each function (census_query, num_checker, time_checker, cat_checker) and checker (geo_checker, year_checker). Then will return a final tibble at the end.\n\n\n\n\n# Main API Query Function\n# Added combined_vars and for loop to validate and check inputted columns are valid\n\nmain_query &lt;- function(year = \"2022\", \n                       geography_level = \"All\", \n                       geography_subset,  \n                       get = \"SEX,AGEP,PWGTP\") {\n    combined_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\", \"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\", \"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n    get_list &lt;- strsplit(get, \",\")\n    for (i in get_list[[1]]) {\n      if (i %in% combined_vars) {\n        cat(\"Column (\",i ,\") entered is valid.\")\n      }\n      else (\n        stop(\"Column (\",i,\") entered is not valid.

This suggests a diverse population with a mix of younger and older individuals.\nGender Distribution Male = 29,940 (50.03%) Female = 29,901 (49.97%)\nWhich shows not much a difference in gender distribution\n\n\n\n# Create a plot of educational attainment by age, colored by gender\nggplot(everything, aes(x = SCHL, y = AGEP, fill = SEX)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational Attainment\", y = \"Age\", fill = \"Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a contingency table of education by gender\ntable(everything$SCHL, everything$SEX)\n\n    \n     Male Female\n  0   830    762\n  1   730    772\n  10  414    363\n  11  483    458\n  12  504    448\n  13  587    524\n  14  763    579\n  15  444    346\n  16 4335   4072\n  17 1118    724\n  18 1585   1690\n  19 3288   3139\n  2   392    381\n  20 1729   2032\n  21 6345   6933\n  22 2679   3291\n  23  696    588\n  24  558    473\n  3   353    312\n  4   311    265\n  5   304    344\n  6   354    328\n  7   347    363\n  8   411    306\n  9   380    408\n\n\nThis analysis gives us a detailed picture of educational attainment patterns across age groups and genders in your population. It highlights the progress made in educational equality, particularly in higher education, while also pointing out areas where disparities still exist.\nFrom the contingency table we can compare the two groups (Male vs Female) The most common education level for both genders is “21” (Bachelor’s degree), followed by “16” (Regular high school diploma). Women tend to outnumber men in Associate’s degrees (20) and Bachelor’s degrees (21). Men slightly outnumber women in Professional degrees beyond a bachelor’s degree (23).\nFrom the box plot we observe following things\nThere’s a wide range of ages for most education levels, indicating lifelong learning or varied educational paths. The median age generally increases with higher levels of educational attainment. Lower education levels (0-9) show a wide age range, possibly indicating both young individuals still in school and older individuals with limited formal education. Higher education levels (16-24) show higher median ages, as expected. There’s a noticeable jump in median age for doctorate degrees (24), with females having a slightly higher median age than males.\n\n\n\n\n# Get summary of transportation methods\nsummary_stats &lt;- summary.census(everything)\nprint(summary_stats$categorical_summary$`Means of transportation to work`)\n\n                                 N/A                   Car, truck, or van \n                               29658                                21488 \n                              Walked                     Worked from home \n                                 816                                 6791 \n                        Other method                                  Bus \n                                 272                                  279 \n             Subway or elevated rail Long-distance train or commuter rail \n                                  13                                   15 \n   Light rail, streetcar, or trolley                            Ferryboat \n                                 104                                    6 \n                             Taxicab                           Motorcycle \n                                  17                                   50 \n                             Bicycle \n                                 332 \n\n# Create a plot of commute times by transportation method\nplot(everything, cat_var = \"JWTRNS\", num_var = \"JWMNP\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis gives us a clear picture of the transportation landscape in your population. The dominance of personal vehicles, the significant proportion of remote workers, and the relatively low usage of public transit are key findings that have important implications for urban planning, environmental policies, and quality of life in the area.\nNon-commuters or Unspecified: The largest category is “N/A” (49.6%), which likely includes non-workers, remote workers, or those with unspecified commute methods.\nVehicle Dominance: Among those who commute, personal vehicles (car, truck, or van) are overwhelmingly the most common method, used by 36.0% of the total population and 70.9% of specified commuters. Remote Work Trend: A significant portion (11.4%) work from home, reflecting modern work trends and potentially impacting traditional commute patterns.\nActive Transportation: Walking (1.4%) and cycling (0.6%) combined account for 2% of commuters, representing a small but notable group using active transportation.\nPublic Transit: All forms of public transit (bus, light rail, subway, train) combined account for only about 0.7% of commuters, suggesting limited public transit infrastructure or usage.\nAlternative Methods: Motorcycles, taxicabs, and ferryboats are used by a very small fraction of commuters, likely reflecting niche transportation needs or preferences.\n\n\n\n\n# Create a plot of rent burden by household language\nplot(everything, cat_var = \"HHL\", num_var = \"GRPIP\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the relationship between household language and rent burden, addressing the question about the connection between household language and economic indicators. The data suggests that there are indeed significant differences in economic stress related to housing costs across different language groups.\n\nLanguage Disparities: There’s a clear disparity in rent burden across language groups, with English-only households generally facing lower rent burdens.\nVulnerable Groups: Spanish-speaking households and those speaking “Other Languages” appear to face the highest rent burdens, suggesting greater economic vulnerability.\n\nVariability Within Groups: All language groups show significant variability in rent burden, indicating that factors beyond language (such as income, location, or occupation) play important roles. 3. Outlines: All groups have outliers with extremely high rent burdens (over 75% of income), but these are more prevalent in non-English speaking households.\n\nEconomic Integration: The overlap in distributions suggests that while there are trends, language alone doesn’t determine economic status or rent burden.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Reclassify transportation categories\neverything$transport_category &lt;- case_when(\n  everything$JWTRNS == \"1\" ~ \"Car\",\n  everything$JWTRNS %in% c(\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"7\") ~ \"Public Transport\",\n  TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n)\n\n# Filter for car and public transport users with non-zero GRPIP\ntransport_rent_data &lt;- everything[everything$transport_category %in% c(\"Car\", \"Public Transport\") & everything$GRPIP &gt; 0, ]\n\n# Ensure transport_category is a factor\ntransport_rent_data$transport_category &lt;- factor(transport_rent_data$transport_category)\n\n# Summary statistics\ncar_summary &lt;- summary(transport_rent_data$GRPIP[transport_rent_data$transport_category == \"Car\"])\npt_summary &lt;- summary(transport_rent_data$GRPIP[transport_rent_data$transport_category == \"Public Transport\"])\n\nprint(\"Summary for Car Users:\")\n\n[1] \"Summary for Car Users:\"\n\nprint(car_summary)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

    "text": "Next, we are going to show how URL can interact with the PUMS’ API. Typically we’d start with a more bare URL when building a URL from scratch (more on that later), but I ended choosing this one because it provided a more visually appealing output as an example. After setting up the URL and making a GET, request to PUMS’ API (a request sent to a server asking an API to provide a service/information), we’ll take that raw data, and parse it into JSON. The initial_parse returns a tibble with the column names on the first row, so we extract those names and set them as the column names. Then we drop the first row and print a nice little tibble to get a glimpse of what information the example_url contains (take a look below!). Here we have a small tibble, 6x4, because we used the function head. These are the steps to querying APIs. So in short, we assign a URL, formulate the API request, send it, allow time to handle the response, and process the data.\n\n\n# Sample API call, transformed to tibble\nexample_url &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/pums?get=SEX,PWGTP,MAR&SCHL=24\"\ninitial_response &lt;- GET(url = example_url)\ninitial_parse &lt;- fromJSON(rawToChar(initial_response$content))\ncol_names &lt;- (initial_parse[1,])\ncolnames(initial_parse) &lt;- col_names\ninitial_parse &lt;- initial_parse[-1,]\ninitial_parse &lt;- as_tibble(initial_parse)\nhead(initial_parse)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  SEX   PWGTP MAR   SCHL \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2     6     5     24   \n2 2     23    2     24   \n3 1     23    3     24   \n4 1     80    5     24   \n5 1     16    1     24   \n6 1     107   3     24   \n\n\n\nTo keep things simple and organized, below are all of the variables and their assigned values. Here we created vectors for each variable to reference later on.\n\n\n# Numeric variables\nnum_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\")\n\n# Categorical variables\ncat_vars &lt;- c(\"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\")\n\n# Time variables\ntime_vars &lt;- c(\"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n\n# Geography variables\ngeo_vars &lt;- c(\"All\", \"Region\", \"Division\", \"State\")\n\n# Combined variables (numeric categorical, time)\ncombined_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\", \"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\", \"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n\n\nNext we’ll dive into all of the functions we made in order to create our main API query. The first one we have is the year_checker function. Our if statement here only allows the function to pass if the year is between 2010 to 2022 (values are inclusive). However, if the year falls outside of the range, a stop function will raise an error message and cease execution of the code.\n\n\n# Year Checker\n# Function to check if entered year is valid\n\nyear_checker &lt;- function(year) {\n  if (year &gt; 2022 | year &lt; 2010) {\n    stop(\"Invalid year value. Please type in a number between 2010 and 2022.\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nOur second function, the num_checker, checks and coerces our assigned numeric and time variables to their respective data types. Due to the parsed JSON data, our data defaulted to a data type of character. Coercing the variables to the desired data type allows for meaning manipulation and analysis. This function contains 1 parameter and takes in 2 vectors, num_vars and time_vars, which is used to determine if the user input is of type num or time then converts it respectively to its desired data type. The function works by looping the column names from initial_parse. Each column name is checked to see if its name matches any from the 2 vectors, num_vars or time_vars. If the column name matches in num_vars, it will be converted to numeric through the use of as.numeric. Similarly with time_vars, it will be converted to a time format through the use of as.POSIXct. Once the function finishes looping, it will return the modified tibble/dataframe.\n\n\n# Numeric Checker\n# Function to convert columns to desired numeric data types\n\nnum_checker &lt;- function(initial_parse) {\n    num_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\")\n    time_vars &lt;- c(\"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n    col_names &lt;- colnames(initial_parse) \n      for (name in col_names) {\n         if (name %in% num_vars) {\n            print(name)   \n            initial_parse[[name]] &lt;- as.numeric(initial_parse[[name]])\n            \n         }\n        if (name %in% time_vars) {\n            print(name)   \n            #initial_parse[[name]] &lt;- as.POSIXct(initial_parse[[name]], format = \"%H:%M\")\n            \n        }\n      }\n    return(initial_parse)\n}\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# initial_parse &lt;- num_checker(initial_parse)\n\n\nOur time checker function works to change our time_vars into desired time data tpes.\n\n\n# Time Checker - NOT FINISHED\n# Function to convert columns to desired time data types\n# Currently NOT a function yet, but almost\n\n# JWAP - Example J.

This function contains 1 parameter and takes in 1 vector, which is used to determine if the user input is of type factor then converts it respectively to its desired data type.\n\n\n# Categorical checker\n# Function to convert columns to desired factor data types\n\ncat_checker &lt;- function(initial_parse) {\n    cat_vars &lt;- c(\"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\")\n    col_names &lt;- colnames(initial_parse) \n      for (name in col_names) {\n         if (name %in% cat_vars) {\n            print(name)   \n            initial_parse[[name]] &lt;- as.factor(initial_parse[[name]])\n    }\n      }\n    initial_parse &lt;- initial_parse %&gt;%\n      mutate(\n        SEX = recode(SEX, \"1\" = \"Male\", \"2\" = \"Female\"))\n      return(initial_parse)\n}\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# cat_checker(initial_parse)\n\n\nNext we have the geography checker. This function has 1 parameter and takes in 1 vector. If the provided geography_level is in the geo_vars vector, it will print that the geography level is valid. If not then it will print is not valid.\n\n\n# Geography Checker\n# Function to specify and  check if geography level is correct\n\ngeo_checker &lt;- function(geography_level, geography_subset) {\n  geo_vars &lt;- c(\"All\", \"Region\", \"Division\", \"State\")\n  if (geography_level %in% geo_vars) {\n    print(\"Geography level is valid.\") \n  }\n  else {\n    print(\"Geography level is not valid.\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# geo_checker(\"State\", \"08\")\n\n\nHere we have a function to query the census. This function contains 4 parameters. First, an empty tibble is initialized in order to store the results; this is important as it holds the multiple tibbles to later bind together. We assign a variable named year_list to take on the function string split for parameter, year, because we want to allow the user to be able to specify multiple years of survey data. String split works here because when inputting multiple years, “2012,2013,2015”, the user needs to input the years all as one string, then strsplit will work to split the different years into a list of year to call each year separately. The for loop at the bottom, (i in year_list[[1]]), loops over the list of years from the user into the query_url, allowing them to make API requests for each given year.\nNext, there are some words that we hard coded into the URL because we needed to return those columns, we chose: “PWGTP”, “GASP”, and “FER”. However, if the user doesn’t know, they could input one of these columns again, producing a duplicate column. To fix this, we have to use grepl, to search for a string within a string then we use gsub to remove the said string. The second gsub is a catch all, removing commas from before/after the string due to user input. This way, even if the user inputs those columns, it would no longer create a duplicate. Then we create an if statement where it does not allow the user to input a geography_subset if they choose “All” by creating a variable named geo_meta and add it onto our query_url below. So to briefly go over our first example, bottom portion of the code is using the given query_url, we send a GET request to formulate the API request, allow time to handle the response, process the data, extract column nam, apply them accordingly, then create tibbles. As mentioned earlier, if user inputs multiple years then the for loop won’t end until the last inputted year, then the bind_rows function will combine all of the tibbles from each year of the user input together.\n\n\n# Function to Query the Census API \n# Created if statements using grepl/gsub to remove duplicate columns\n# Allow users to call multiple years then combining tibbles as the end using bind_rowss\n# Used helper GET here then turned into tibble\n\ncensus_query &lt;- function(year, geography_level, geography_subset, get) {\n    initial_parse_final &lt;- tibble()\n    year_list &lt;- strsplit(year, \",\")\n    url &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/\"\n    if (grepl(\"PWGTP\", get)) {\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"PWGTP|PWGTP,\",'',get) # to remove actual value or the comma after\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"^\\\\,|\\\\,$\",'',get) # catch all, if there's a comma before/after of user input\n    }\n    if (grepl(\"GASP\", get)) {\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"GASP|GASP,\",'',get)\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"^\\\\,|\\\\,$\",'',get)\n    }\n    if (grepl(\"FER\", get)) {\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"FER|FER,\",'',get)\n      get &lt;- gsub(\"^\\\\,|\\\\,$\",'',get)\n    }\n    geo_meta &lt;- paste0(\"&for=\", geography_level,\":\",geography_subset)\n    if (geography_level == \"All\") {\n      geo_meta &lt;- \"\"\n    }\n    for (i in year_list[[1]]) {\n      query_url &lt;- paste0(url,i,\"/acs/acs1/pums?\",\"get=PWGTP,GASP,FER,\",get,geo_meta)\n      initial_response &lt;- GET(url = query_url)\n      initial_parse &lt;- fromJSON(rawToChar(initial_response$content))\n      col_names &lt;- (initial_parse[1,])\n      colnames(initial_parse) &lt;- col_names\n      initial_parse &lt;- initial_parse[-1,]\n      initial_parse &lt;- as_tibble(initial_parse)\n      initial_parse_final &lt;- bind_rows(initial_parse,initial_parse_final)\n    }\n    return(initial_parse_final)\n}\n\n\n# Testing purposes/example\n# initial_parse &lt;- census_query(year = \"2011,2014\", \"State\", \"08\", \"AGEP,SEX\")\n\n\nNow we can create our final/main API query. This API query contains 4 parameters (year = “2022”, geography_level = “All”, geography_subset and get = “SEX,AGEP,PWGTP”, with their respective defaults) and takes in vector combined_vars. We create a strsplit for the get results, similarly to what we did for the years in the census_query results. When a user inputs variables, it will check and ensure those column names are valid. If they are then it will print, “Column X entered is valid” and if not then it will tell the user to try again. After that, initial_parse is reassigned and overwritten once it goes through each function (census_query, num_checker, time_checker, cat_checker) and checker (geo_checker, year_checker). Then will return a final tibble at the end.\n\n\n\n\n# Main API Query Function\n# Added combined_vars and for loop to validate and check inputted columns are valid\n\nmain_query &lt;- function(year = \"2022\", \n                       geography_level = \"All\", \n                       geography_subset,  \n                       get = \"SEX,AGEP,PWGTP\") {\n    combined_vars &lt;- c(\"AGEP\", \"GASP\", \"GRPIP\", \"JWMNP\", \"PWGTP\", \"FER\", \"HHL\", \"HISPEED\", \"JWTRNS\", \"SCH\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\", \"JWAP\", \"JWDP\")\n    get_list &lt;- strsplit(get, \",\")\n    for (i in get_list[[1]]) {\n      if (i %in% combined_vars) {\n        cat(\"Column (\",i ,\") entered is valid.\")\n      }\n      else (\n        stop(\"Column (\",i,\") entered is not valid.

Let’s understand the relationship between different variables and interpret the data using our summary and plot functions.\nFor example we would like to get the answers of following questions #### What is the overall age and gender distribution of the population?\n\n# Get summary statistics\nsummary_stats &lt;- summary.census(everything)\nprint(summary_stats$numeric_summary$Age)\n\n$mean\n[1] 38.80219\n\n$sd\n[1] 22.42793\n\nprint(summary_stats$categorical_summary$Sex)\n\n  Male Female \n 29940  29901 \n\n# Create an age distribution plot by gender\nplot(everything, cat_var = \"SEX\", num_var = \"AGEP\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summary statistics for age show:\nMean age: 38.80 years Standard deviation: 22.43 years\nThis indicates that:\nThe average age of the population is about 39 years old. There’s a considerable spread in ages, with a standard deviation of about 22 years. This suggests a diverse population with a mix of younger and older individuals.\nGender Distribution Male = 29,940 (50.03%) Female = 29,901 (49.97%)\nWhich shows not much a difference in gender distribution\n\n\n\n# Create a plot of educational attainment by age, colored by gender\nggplot(everything, aes(x = SCHL, y = AGEP, fill = SEX)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational Attainment\", y = \"Age\", fill = \"Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a contingency table of education by gender\ntable(everything$SCHL, everything$SEX)\n\n    \n     Male Female\n  0   830    762\n  1   730    772\n  10  414    363\n  11  483    458\n  12  504    448\n  13  587    524\n  14  763    579\n  15  444    346\n  16 4335   4072\n  17 1118    724\n  18 1585   1690\n  19 3288   3139\n  2   392    381\n  20 1729   2032\n  21 6345   6933\n  22 2679   3291\n  23  696    588\n  24  558    473\n  3   353    312\n  4   311    265\n  5   304    344\n  6   354    328\n  7   347    363\n  8   411    306\n  9   380    408\n\n\nThis analysis gives us a detailed picture of educational attainment patterns across age groups and genders in your population. It highlights the progress made in educational equality, particularly in higher education, while also pointing out areas where disparities still exist.\nFrom the contingency table we can compare the two groups (Male vs Female) The most common education level for both genders is “21” (Bachelor’s degree), followed by “16” (Regular high school diploma). Women tend to outnumber men in Associate’s degrees (20) and Bachelor’s degrees (21). Men slightly outnumber women in Professional degrees beyond a bachelor’s degree (23).\nFrom the box plot we observe following things\nThere’s a wide range of ages for most education levels, indicating lifelong learning or varied educational paths. The median age generally increases with higher levels of educational attainment. Lower education levels (0-9) show a wide age range, possibly indicating both young individuals still in school and older individuals with limited formal education. Higher education levels (16-24) show higher median ages, as expected. There’s a noticeable jump in median age for doctorate degrees (24), with females having a slightly higher median age than males.\n\n\n\n\n# Get summary of transportation methods\nsummary_stats &lt;- summary.census(everything)\nprint(summary_stats$categorical_summary$`Means of transportation to work`)\n\n                                 N/A                   Car, truck, or van \n                               29658                                21488 \n                              Walked                     Worked from home \n                                 816                                 6791 \n                        Other method                                  Bus \n                                 272                                  279 \n             Subway or elevated rail Long-distance train or commuter rail \n                                  13                                   15 \n   Light rail, streetcar, or trolley                            Ferryboat \n                                 104                                    6 \n                             Taxicab                           Motorcycle \n                                  17                                   50 \n                             Bicycle \n                                 332 \n\n# Create a plot of commute times by transportation method\nplot(everything, cat_var = \"JWTRNS\", num_var = \"JWMNP\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis gives us a clear picture of the transportation landscape in your population. The dominance of personal vehicles, the significant proportion of remote workers, and the relatively low usage of public transit are key findings that have important implications for urban planning, environmental policies, and quality of life in the area.\nNon-commuters or Unspecified: The largest category is “N/A” (49.6%), which likely includes non-workers, remote workers, or those with unspecified commute methods.\nVehicle Dominance: Among those who commute, personal vehicles (car, truck, or van) are overwhelmingly the most common method, used by 36.0% of the total population and 70.9% of specified commuters. Remote Work Trend: A significant portion (11.4%) work from home, reflecting modern work trends and potentially impacting traditional commute patterns.\nActive Transportation: Walking (1.4%) and cycling (0.6%) combined account for 2% of commuters, representing a small but notable group using active transportation.\nPublic Transit: All forms of public transit (bus, light rail, subway, train) combined account for only about 0.7% of commuters, suggesting limited public transit infrastructure or usage.\nAlternative Methods: Motorcycles, taxicabs, and ferryboats are used by a very small fraction of commuters, likely reflecting niche transportation needs or preferences.\n\n\n\n\n# Create a plot of rent burden by household language\nplot(everything, cat_var = \"HHL\", num_var = \"GRPIP\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the relationship between household language and rent burden, addressing the question about the connection between household language and economic indicators. The data suggests that there are indeed significant differences in economic stress related to housing costs across different language groups.\n\nLanguage Disparities: There’s a clear disparity in rent burden across language groups, with English-only households generally facing lower rent burdens.\nVulnerable Groups: Spanish-speaking households and those speaking “Other Languages” appear to face the highest rent burdens, suggesting greater economic vulnerability.\n\nVariability Within Groups: All language groups show significant variability in rent burden, indicating that factors beyond language (such as income, location, or occupation) play important roles. 3. Outlines: All groups have outliers with extremely high rent burdens (over 75% of income), but these are more prevalent in non-English speaking households.\n\nEconomic Integration: The overlap in distributions suggests that while there are trends, language alone doesn’t determine economic status or rent burden.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Reclassify transportation categories\neverything$transport_category &lt;- case_when(\n  everything$JWTRNS == \"1\" ~ \"Car\",\n  everything$JWTRNS %in% c(\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"7\") ~ \"Public Transport\",\n  TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n)\n\n# Filter for car and public transport users with non-zero GRPIP\ntransport_rent_data &lt;- everything[everything$transport_category %in% c(\"Car\", \"Public Transport\") & everything$GRPIP &gt; 0, ]\n\n# Ensure transport_category is a factor\ntransport_rent_data$transport_category &lt;- factor(transport_rent_data$transport_category)\n\n# Summary statistics\ncar_summary &lt;- summary(transport_rent_data$GRPIP[transport_rent_data$transport_category == \"Car\"])\npt_summary &lt;- summary(transport_rent_data$GRPIP[transport_rent_data$transport_category == \"Public Transport\"])\n\nprint(\"Summary for Car Users:\")\n\n[1] \"Summary for Car Users:\"\n\nprint(car_summary)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.
